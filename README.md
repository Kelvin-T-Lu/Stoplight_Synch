# Stoplight_Synch
Author: Kelvin Lu and Kristopher Van A project based off Harvard's OS161. This project has priority by distinguishing trucks and cars. This project simulates a 3 way vehicle intersection using threads. 

Issues: 
Due to the logic of having 2 seperate mutex lock for left turns, there's a slight alteration of priorties with vehicles.
